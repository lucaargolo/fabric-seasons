# <p align="center">SEASONAL</p>

Seasonal is a fork of *[Fabric Seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)*. What is different? All non-technical blocks and items have been removed to take seasons to their most basic form. As well, sub-seasons have been added for more gradual transitions of time in both color and plant growth!

If you plan to use this with OptiFabric + OptiFine you *MUST* turn Custom Colors `OFF` and turn Swamp Colors `ON` unless you want all the colors to be broken!

Seasonal also supports colors for the *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)* resource pack through the Fabric companion mod *[Catherine](https://github.com/yurisuika/Catherine)*!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/seasonal.git

cd ./seasonal

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
