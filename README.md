# [Seasons](http://suikacraft.com)

Seasons is a fork of *[Fabric Seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)* by D4rkness_King. What is different? Asides from early 1.18 support, all non-technical blocks and items have been removed to take seasons to their most basic form. As well, some biome weather and seasonal colours have been improved and tailored for the *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)* resourcepack.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/seasons.git

cd ./catherine

./gradlew build

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
